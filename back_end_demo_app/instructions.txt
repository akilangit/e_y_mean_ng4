Backend App
============
Step 1: Create Express Project. (It's already created) and run it.
        express my_contact_manager
        npm install 
        npm start

Step 2: In your browser navigate to http://localhost:3000. and you should see the text 'Express'

Step 3: We had a code-walkthrough already. Let's stop the server (ctrl+c) and start the server in debug mode.
        Click on the Debug  (Ctrl+shift+D) in your Visual Studio Code Editor. It should start the app in debug mode.

Step 4: Go to http://localhost:3000 and see the page with same 'Express' text

Step 5: Go to Project folder, and routes/index.js 
        res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
        and then type the following line
        res.json({message: "Success"});

Step 6: Now, you have successfully made your rest API's to serve JSON, instead of template
